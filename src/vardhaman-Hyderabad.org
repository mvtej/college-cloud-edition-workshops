Dear All,

Siva, Raghupathi Ravi Kiran and I went to Vardhaman Engg College for
conducting workshop. We started with a demo of Online version and
moved to College Cloud.  We had both versions running as there were
constraints of bandwidth

Following are some of the observations


1) Some of the labs did not load (image processing and problem
   solving) for online version.  Action item - Lalit will prepare a
   rubic for identification of working labs and will contact Virtual
   Labs participating institutes to identify those labs and prepare a
   consolidated list.  Will send an email and have the list ready by
   Apr 17th.

2) On college cloud - labs that are deployed for use were not opening
   consistently for users including Feedback form. Ravi Shankar garu,
   Maruthi Rao garu to have a meeting on this tomorrow(Apr 7) to
   discuss on College Cloud with Professor Venkatesh sir. An action
   plan will emerge after the meeting.  This could include removal of
   Wifi router as DHCP, forum for interacting with participants of
   College Cloud Workshop held @ IIIT-Hyd on Mar 15, etc

3) Understand the need and removal of labs that are in "in
   progress/under construction" from open edX.  Priya, Ravi Garu and
   Lalit to discuss on this.

4) Usability for accessing labs has been a struggle. Lalit to reach
   out Usability team on this again !


There were 30 students from ECE, CSE and IT and 2 Faculty from Mech
and ECE.  The feedback has been mixed, we also collected physical copy
of feedback form as the online feedback form was not completed.

Also, it would be interesting to see if the participating students
have accessed the Virtual Labs after college hours - may be Ravi Kiran
can take this up for data analysis

Siva/Raghupathi/Ravi Kiran - please add/modify if I missed anything


Sincerely
Lalit

These are my observations,

Online version ( Internet):

1. Reasons for Image processing labs and problem solving and even data
   structures lab too, are,

   Following could be factors,
   1. Institute/College Overall Internet Speed
   2. Internet speed in the computers lab that has given to us for the
      workshop by the college.
   3. How participants are accessing the labs( Over Wifi or LAN),
       1.  If They use LAN, Labs would load properly.
       2. If they use Wifi, again accessing the labs depends on wifi
          signal strength here.

2. Above two labs were working in previous three workshops( GMRIT,
   Matrusri and MJCET).


Offline Version ( Intranet, College Cloud)

1. I wonder, we have conducted three workshops, in this three
   workshops we used "Image Processing lab, Computer Programing Lab,
   data structures labs and also other labs for the demo and also we
   have given them these labs to perform experiments.


These are the things we may have to look into,

Offline Version
1. Workshop participants have to use LAN, then only we will not face
   above problems( As said by Mr. Lalit).  Based on previous workshops
   i am mentioning this point here. We have not faced Issue with
   loading three above labs in previous workshop.
2. If they use Wifi, max 10-15 labs can be accessed by the lab users.
   Unfortunately, This is what happened at Vardhaman College, in
   Vardhman College, desktop computers are supporting wifi( desktop
   computers are able connect to WiFi.

   Most of the colleges would not be having this advantage, so, in
   this case, they will be using LAN. Then there will not be "labs are
   not loading properly or slowly issue.

3. As Lalit said, there are some labs that are not working, we have to
   remove them from College Cloud.



I would be adding more points to this thread

Dear Shiva/Lalit,

I guess this conversation should be part of the the repository that
holds all workshop information.  You can send an email pointing to
that link.

Sincerely
Thirumal Ravula

What was happened in Vardhaman Enginneering College?

There were around 30 participants,

There were three connections to access the labs
 1.  Two Wi-Fis, College Wifi which has Internet access and College
     Cloud Wi-Fi which has no Internet access.  Due to College Wi-fi
     was very slow, even for 5 users/participants, labs/any other
     websites were not loading faster.  During the slides
     presentation, Lalit has connected to College Wi-fi to show our
     labs on online. we have seen loading issue, so thought of using
     College Cloud edition. We enabled College Cloud for the demo.
 
 2. There is a LAN connection also,


Now, the students have chance of choosing any one from three available
choices. So, initially all of them are connected to their own college
wifi which was not working properly for all of them at a time.

Then,some them are connected to College Cloud wi-fi which supports
only for 10-15 users/participants but there were 30 participants which
is not suitable over wifi ( as we know) to access the labs.


3. For feedback, yes it was not loading properly. Because even lab's
   experiments not loading properly. How do we expect feedback page
   will open instantly just like that.



Finally, based on my observations. ( If my observations may be wrong,
please correct me personally or in this email thread)

1. If they are more than 10 lab users are using labs over the Wifi,
   labs will not load properly on both online and offline. It depends
   on Internet bandwidth speed.
2. We have to change cluster setup design.
    1. No load balancer
    2. One way traffic for the experiments . vlabs.ac.in(Open-edx
       Platform)--> Router-->Reverseproxy-->Lab VM. there is no other
       way to access the labs. I felt, for the college cloud, there is
       too much burden on Open edX platform,then router, and then
       reverseproxy.

3. I request, we have to rethink offline solution setup for better
      performance results.
